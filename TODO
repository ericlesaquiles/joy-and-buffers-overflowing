1) Create setup video that covers...
    a) how to setup the program
        i) vagrant up (you can use your own VM as long as it has apt-get, i.e. anything Debian based)
        ii) compile authorization1.c
        iii) run the code with test value
    b) NOW STOP THE VIDEO and try to get the program to print Access Granted without the passphrase.
    c) Explain how that happens by... walking through the program with gdb
    d) authorization2 problem
        i) Compile authorization2.c
        ii) Force the authorization2 program to print Access Granted anyway.
        iii) Helpful hints:
            * explain memory segmentation
            * explain stack frame setup
            * explain how to find the instruction that you want to force it to use
            * explain how to throw in that addresses
